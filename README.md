Build instructions for (Maven) Central artifacts
================================================

As part of [Reproducible Builds efforts for the JVM](https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/jvm/), this repository is an attempt
at writing rebuild instructions for the artifacts available in [(Maven) Central](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/),
equivalent to the packaging instructions that are maintained by every Linux distribution
(for example Debian's [debian/rules](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-source#s-debianrules) or ArchLinux's PKGBUILD)
