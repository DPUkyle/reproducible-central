Build instructions for (Maven) Central artifacts
================================================

As part of [Reproducible Builds efforts for the JVM](https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/jvm/), this repository is an attempt
at writing rebuild instructions for the artifacts available in [(Maven) Central](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/),
equivalent to the packaging instructions that are maintained by every Linux distribution
(for example Debian's [debian/rules](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-source#s-debianrules) or ArchLinux's PKGBUILD)

Once rebuild instructions are clear enough for people from different horizons to be able to rebuild typical projects,
we'll see buildinfo more in details: how does it link to build instructions and add extra details?

And in the future, once formats are stabilized, it is expecte that every project provides its rebuild instructions when publishing to Central, then the current work is not necessary to be maintained forever: just for old artifacts.

### Interesting cases built with Maven

- [Plexus Utils](https://codehaus-plexus.github.io/plexus-utils/) = `org.codehaus.plexus:`[`plexus-utils:*`](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/codehaus/plexus/plexus-utils/)\
  __Simple jar__ from basic java code that could be built without Maven but with javac and jar commands.\
  No buildable source tarball available anywhere, just scm (when still available, since migrations over time)\
  Notice: target bytecode != minimum required JDK version to build != effective JDK used for the reference build on Central (example: for plexus-utils 3.1.1, target = 6, minimum = 7, used = 8)\
  Notice 2: bytecode generated by different major JDK version is very different, then to reproduce the binary published in central, it's the effective JDK version that counts, not minimum (even less target)

- [Jansi](http://fusesource.github.io/jansi/) = `org.fusesource.jansi:`[`jansi:*`](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/fusesource/jansi/jansi/)\
  Jar built from Java code and uber-jar with dependencies.\
  Notice: __multi-module Maven build__ (root artifactId = `jansi-project`, modules = `jansi` & `example`, groupId = [`org.fusesource.jansi`](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/fusesource/jansi/))\
  For future automation, it's more convenient to place rebuild instructions on root artifact and let modules point to the root
  (and ignore the fact that the useul artifact is jansi and the git repository name jansi.git is the id of a module instead of the root artifactId):
  this will permit a Maven plugin to automatically adapt buildinfo format in root vs modules

- [Maven (core)](https://maven.apache.org/ref/) = `org.apache.maven:`[`apache-maven:2.0.10+`](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/apache-maven/)\
  multi-module (root artifactId = `maven`, modules vary over time), buildable source in repository as `apache-maven-<version>-src.zip` and `.tar.gz` in `org.apache.maven:apache-maven` module\
  Notice: added `-Papache-release -Dgpg.skip` to rebuild instructions to get source and javadoc attached artifacts (`-sources.jar` and `-javadoc.jar`), useful to check reproducibility since downloaded by IDEs

- [Jansi native](https://github.com/fusesource/jansi-native) = `org.fusesource.jansi:`[`jansi-native:*`](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/fusesource/jansi/jansi-native/)\
  java code plus additional native (then build-platform dependant) code.\
  Until 1.5, native code published as jansi-native artifactId, since 1.6 published
  as separate `jansi-${platform}` where platform may be `osx`, `linux32`, `linux64`, `windows32`, `windows64`, `freebsd32` or `freebsd64`
